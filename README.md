# Linter / Commit Messages

While developing this library you should take an attention to linter rules, all of your codes and commit messages, because you can't do any development without checking by rules.

<span style="color:red;">**Notice:**</span> Before commit to changes, [HuskyJs](https://github.com/typicode/husky) checking these commit messages / linter rules

If you get a lint's error when you commiting a message, you can check for [eslint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) linter rules or if you get an error because of your commit message you can check for [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) rules to how it should be.
